# Setup # 
> ⚠️ Game will work NOT work on online compilers and on Mac OS.

Compile the `birdgame.cpp` file found in the `birdgame` folder.

1. Single player mode : Press spacebar to jump.
2. AI mode : watch AI bird play but keep in mind that the AI bird will never die.

- At any time, there is at most 2 pipes on screen. 
- The bird only moves vertically while the pipes moves horizontally to the left. 

- `pipe[0]` always denotes the index of the pipe closest to the bird. Once this pipe is behind the bird, it disappears.

# Future work #
- [x] Add gameplay to README
- [x] Remove unicode characters so that code can run on IDE not supporting unicode.
- [x] Add code to get rid of flickering cursor 
- [x] Add AI bird
- [x] Fix collision bug (when bird is between 2 pipes, it can partially collide with the bottom pipe.)
- [x] Add code explanation with diagram

- [ ] Add flapping wings to [bird](https://imgur.com/gallery/gKpkYqL).
- [ ] Add different difficulty modes (vary gap between pipes, speed of bird, ...)
