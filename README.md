# AI Flappy Bird

# Inspirations #

# Setup # 
Compile the `birdgame.cpp` file found in the `birdgame` folder.

This program will not run on online compilers as it uses non standard `conio.h` and `dos.h` header files.

# How to play #
1. Single player mode : Press spacebar to jump.
2. AI mode : watch AI bird play but keep in mind that the AI bird will never die.

# Future work #
- [x] Add gameplay to README
- [x] Remove unicode characters so that code can run on IDE not supporting unicode.
- [x] Add code to get rid of flickering cursor 
- [x] Add AI bird
- [x] Fix collision bug (when bird is between 2 pipes, it can partially collide with the bottom pipe.)

- [ ] Add code explanation with diagram
- [ ] Add flapping wings to [bird](https://imgur.com/gallery/gKpkYqL).
- [ ] Add different difficulty modes (vary gap between pipes, speed of bird, ...)
